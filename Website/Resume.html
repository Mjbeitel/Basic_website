                <p>
                    Hello, My name is Matthew Beitel, and I have just graduated from <b>Dalhousie Univeristy</b>
                    with a <b>Bachelors degree</b> in <b>Electrical Engineering</b>. I have a keen intrest
                    in the field of embedded systems, specifically the firmware design. I also have
                    a passion for hardware design from circuit simulation, protoyping, to final PCB design.
                    I thank you for viewing my website that I designed and reviewing my credentials.
                </p>

                <h2><i>Lemur Vehicle Monitors</i></h2>
                <h2><b><small>Full Time</small></b></h2>
                <h3><b>Work term 1:</b> January 2019 - April 2019</h3>
                <h3><b>Work term 2:</b> January 2020 - April 2020</h3>

                <p>
                    Employed for two separate work terms at Lemur Vehicle Monitors.
                    My job was to select and program various Bluetooth Low Energy IC’s
                    as well as benchmark various OBD2 car scanner products.
                    I gained significant experience with the Arm Cortex M3 and PIC MCU’s as I worked
                    with the BGX13P, and EFR32 with the BGM121 SiP as well as the BM71 PICtail board
                    by microchip. Programming was done using command line API and C, as well as other
                    programs to design the GATT services and characteristics. Benchmarking of the
                    competitors products required testing of car communication protocols
                    (CAN, MSCAN, GMLAN, etc) as well as B.O.M projections and final reports
                    for each product.
                </p>

                <h2><b><small>Part Time</small></b></h2>
                <h3>April 2020 - August 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    While in University, I worked part time for Lemur,
                    performing URL scraping for database entry.
                    This required working knowledge of various
                    car diagnostic systems, as well as helping
                    design efficient processes for data collection
                    on the users end.
